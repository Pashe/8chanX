This branch removes a few features in order to improve compatibility. You should not use this branch if [2.0](https://github.com/Pashe/8chanX/tree/2-0) works for you.
***

This userscript adds various features and options like:
 * Gallery
 * Filters
 * Reverse image search
 * Flag preview
 * Mascots
 * Notifications
 * Relative post dates
 * Post and image counts in the menu
 * Many other poorly written hacks
 * Not as dead as tux's version

This is a userscript, you will need an addon to run it properly
